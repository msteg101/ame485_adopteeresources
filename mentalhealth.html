            <h2>Mental Health</h2>
            <p>Mental Health is something every adoptee faces on a daily basis, fighting their mind and emotions to trust themselves. Many studies have been done comparing the mental health and behavioral health of adopted children and non-adopted children, and the resources show a significant difference, with more mental health and behavioral issues found in adopted children.</p>
            <p>According to the American Academy of Pediatrics, "adopted children are more likely than biological children to have special health care needs, current moderate or severe health problems, learning disability, developmental delay or physical impairment, and other mental health difficulties" (Bramlett, et al, 2007). The trauma of separation from birth parents, identity struggles, and feelings of abandonment can contribute to these mental health challenges.</p>
            <h3>Depression & Grief</h3>
            <p>Adoptees often experience depression and grief related to their adoption. The loss of their birth family and the circumstances surrounding their adoption can lead to feelings of sadness, loneliness, and longing. Many adoptees feel a constant sense of sadness and loss, sometimes creating a sense of depression. The more adoptees can come to terms with their grief, they can begin to heal. It's important for adoptees to have access to mental health support that acknowledges and addresses these unique experiences.</p>

                <blockquote>“But while adoption can bring belonging and stability, it does not erase the pain that came before. Every adoption begins with loss — the loss of a first family, first home, first story. For children, that loss leaves a mark, no matter how young they were when it happened. To support adoptees well, we have to hold both truths at once: adoption can be beautiful, but it can also carry deep grief.” </blockquote>

            <h3>Anxiety</h3>
            <p>Anxiety is another common mental health issue among adoptees. The uncertainty about their origins, fear of rejection, and challenges in forming secure attachments can contribute to heightened anxiety levels.</p>
            <p>Many adoptees describe feeling a constant sense of “waiting for something to go wrong,” or fearing abandonment in relationships, even when they logically know they are safe. This is not a personal flaw—these patterns often stem from trauma imprinted in infancy or early childhood. Adoptees may benefit from therapeutic interventions that focus on building self-esteem, coping skills, and resilience.</p>
            <p>Along with anxiety, adoptees may also experience:</p>
            <ul id="experiences">
                <li>Fear of disappointing others</li>
                <li>Difficulty trusting their own instincts or emotions</li>
                <li>Worry about not belonging</li>
                <li>Sensitivity to rejection or criticism</li>
                <li>Hyper-vigilance in relationships</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Understanding these patterns with compassion, rather than judgment, can help adoptees feel less alone in their struggles.</p>
