        <h2>Health</h2>
        <p>A big frustration to adoptees trying to understand themselves more and find more peace with their history is the lack of medical history most adoptees have. Most adoptees worry about what family history they are missing, what undiagnosed conditions might have been found out with just a few more lines of history in the files. A study by Kernreiter et al.(2020) states “in the case of anonymously adopted children, their knowledge of biological heritage and contact is either strictly limited or impossible, yet these factors are known to play an important role in a stable psychological development of children (Thorn, 2011)”.</p>
        <p>Many adoptees also worry about hereditary conditions that may run in their birth families. Without access to medical history, adoptees may feel anxious about their health and uncertain about potential risks. This lack of information can lead to feelings of vulnerability and frustration.</p>
        <p>Genetic testing services, such as 23andMe or AncestryDNA, have become popular tools for adoptees seeking to uncover their biological heritage and health information. These services can provide insights into genetic predispositions to certain health conditions, as well as connect adoptees with potential biological relatives. However, it's important for adoptees to approach genetic testing with caution, as the results can sometimes be complex and may raise new questions about identity and family connections.</p>

            <h3>How to Support</h3>
            <p>Non-adoptees can support adoptees by respecting their need for medical information and understanding the challenges they face in accessing their medical history. Understanding the struggles of finding diagnoses and medical history can help create a more supportive environment for adoptees.</p>
